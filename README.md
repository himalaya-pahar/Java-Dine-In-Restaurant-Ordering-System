## Java Dine-In Restaurant Ordering System

This Java program simulates a simple text-based restaurant ordering system. Users can view a menu, add or remove menu items to/from their cart, view their current order with itemized prices, and checkout to see the total bill. The application uses object-oriented programming with `Item` and `ViewOrder` classes for menu and order management. It supports adding multiple quantities of menu items and offers a user-friendly console interface for interaction.
